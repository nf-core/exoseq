## Introduction

ExoSeq is a bioinformatics package that performs best-practice analysis pipeline for Exome Sequencing data at the [National Genomics Infastructure](https://ngisweden.scilifelab.se/)
at [SciLifeLab Stockholm](https://www.scilifelab.se/platforms/ngi/), Sweden.

The pipeline is built based on [GATK](https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/best-practices/) best practices using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a bioinformatics workflow tool. The main steps done by pipeline are the following (more information about the processes can be found [here](docs/processes.md)).

* Alignment
* Marking Duplicates
* Recalibration
* Realignment
* Variant Calling
* Variant Filtration
* Variant Evaluation
* Variant Annotation

## Credits
The pipeline was initally developed by Senthilkumar Panneerselvam ([@senthil10](https://github.com/senthil10)) with a little help from Phil Ewels ([@ewels](https://github.com/ewels)) and has been adapted by Alex Peltzer ([@apeltzer](https://github.com/apeltzer)), Marie Gauder ([@mgauder](https://github.com/mgauder)) from QBIC Tuebingen/Germany and Marc Hoeppner ([@marchoeppner] (https://github.com/marchoeppner)) from IKMB Kiel/Germany.
